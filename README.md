# Music-books
I decided to create this repository since I found that (learn-anything) [https://github.com/learn-anything]'s (books) [https://github.com/learn-anything/books] repository was missing important an important topic: music methods.

So here I'm sharing some methods that I own. Unfortunately I only play the trumpet and I don't know very much about other instrument's methods so feel free to open Issues and Pull requests to inscrease this repository ðŸŽµ

## Methods
### Trumpet
 - Arban
 - Charlier
 - Clarke
 - Colins
 - Concone
