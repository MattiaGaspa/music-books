# Music-books
I decided to create this repository since I found that [learn-anything](https://github.com/learn-anything)'s [books](https://github.com/learn-anything/books) repository was missing important an important topic: music methods.

So here I'm sharing some methods that I own. Unfortunately I only play the trumpet and I don't know very much about other instrument's methods so feel free to open Issues and Pull requests to inscrease this repository ðŸŽµ
